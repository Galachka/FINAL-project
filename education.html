      <h1 style="display: flex;justify-content: center;">Education in Kazakhstan</h1>
    

   

<div class="inf">
    Following independence from the Soviet Union, a major economic depression 
    cut "public financing" for education in Kazakhstan, "which dropped from 6% 
    of gross domestic product in 1991 to about 3% in 1994, before rising to 4% 
    in 1999. Elementary- and secondary-school teachers remain badly underpaid;
     in 1993 more than 30,000 teachers (or about one-seventh of the 1990 teaching 
     staff) left education, many of them to seek more lucrative employment.

    In 1994 Kazakhstan had 8,575 elementary and secondary schools (grades one 
    through eleven) attended by approximately 3.2 million students, and 244
     specialized secondary schools with about 
     222,000 students. In 1992 about 51 percent of eligible children were 
     attending some 8,500 preschools in Kazakhstan. In 1994 some 272,100 
     students were enrolled in the republic's sixty-one institutes of higher 
     learning. Fifty-four percent of the students were Kazakh, and 31 percent 
     were Russian.[citation needed]
