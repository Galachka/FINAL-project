              <p class="card-text">Astana is a fascinating city in the midst of an
                   enormous transformation. The capital city of Kazakhstan, Astana 
                   (formerly known as Akmola) took on its new role in 1997 and has
                    been changing rapidly ever since. <span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">Founded in 1830, it was once a
                     defensive fortification against the invading Siberian Cossacks. 
                     During the 1960s, Astana became the centre of the Virgin Lands 
                     Campaign, an attempt by the USSR to rapidly develop agricultural
                      production to feed their expanding empire. Now, this city is 
                      distinctly modern, all thanks to the pet project of President 
                      Nursultan Äbishuly Nazarbayev to make Kazakhstan the cultural 
                      forefront of Central Asia. The city has been spending billion 
                      dollars on international architects, making Astana an interesting 
                      site with its unique mix of futuristic architecture and Kazakh flair.
                       It is home to many impressive government buildings, such as the Presidential 
                       Palace, Parliament House and Supreme Court. Kazakhstani officials mean to mak
                       e Astana the capital not only of the country, but also of Central Asia.

              <p class="card-text">Almaty is the largest city in Kazakhstan and once served 
                  as the capital during the Soviet Union and six years after independence in
                   1991. Set against a backdrop of beautiful snowcapped mountains, Almaty 
                   is built on a slope via which travellers can easily navigate the city 
                   .<span id="dots1">...</span><span id="more1"> The landscape makes this city an excellent one
                    in terms of sports and nature— many hiking trails exist, and snowboarding
                    /skiing is a must-do in winters. Almaty is Kazakhstan’s main financial 
                    center, making it both cosmopolitan and even pricey in terms of living.
                     For those who want a break from horse meat, try Govinda’s for some 
                     vegetarian Indian cuisine. The many Georgian restaurants in Almaty 
                     are also a great option for vegetarian travellers.Sites include the 
                     famous Charyn Canyon, the Ascension Cathedral, the Medeo ice-skating 
                     stadium and the Green Market for a variety of foods and crafts. The name 
                     Almaty has its roots in the medieval settlement Almatau.
                      A disputed theory holds that the name is derived 
                     from the Kazakh word for 'apple' (алма), and is often translated as 
                     "full of apples". Originally it was Almatau which means Apple Mountain.</span>

                    Originally a settlement on the caravan route from Central Asia to China, 
                    Shymkent dates back at least to the 12th century and was more than once 
                    destroyed by nomad attacks. <span id="dots2">...</span><span id="more2">After becoming part of the khanate of Kokand
                     in the early 19th century, it was captured by the Russians in 1864.
                      A pharmaceutical (santonin) works was constructed there in 1885.
                    Shymkent’s population increased twelvefold from 1926 to 1970. 
                    It is now the third largest city in Kazakhstan and a major industrial
                     and cultural centre, as well as an important railway junction.
                      The city has large lead, automatic-press, and cement works,
                       with a chemical industry (processing phosphates from Karatau) 
                       and food and light industries. Shymkent also has teacher-training,

                    It was founded as a Russian fort in 1718, 11 miles (18 km) downstream

                     before the 1917 Revolution more than 11,000 camels passed through annually.

                     in exile as a soldier in a line battalion. The city’s growth was 
                     furthered by the arrival of the railway from Siberia in 1906 and t

                     given due to the eponymous Ukrainian poet's period of exile 
                     in the area. It is located on the Mangyshlak Peninsula and is
                      the capital of the Mangystau Region.
                    Aktau is known for its unique block address system.
                     Almost no streets in Aktau have names; instead, addresses 
                     generally consist of three numbers: the district number,
